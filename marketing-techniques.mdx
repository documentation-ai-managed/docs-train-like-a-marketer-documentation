      ```javascript
      // Example: Simple points system for training
      const awardPoints = (learner, activity) => {
        const basePoints = activity.difficulty * 10;
        learner.points += basePoints;
        return learner;
      };
      ```
      ```python
      # Example: Gamification leaderboard
      def update_leaderboard(participants, scorer):
          sorted_participants = sorted(participants, key=lambda p: p.score, reverse=True)
          return sorted_participants[:10]

  <Expandable title="How do these techniques improve learning outcomes?" default-open="false">
    Marketing techniques address fundamental human psychology that affects learning.
    
    Storytelling engages the brain's natural pattern recognition. Gamification taps into intrinsic motivation systems. Social proof leverages our tendency to conform to group norms. Together, these create an optimal learning environment.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Can I combine multiple techniques?" default-open="false">
    Absolutely, and we recommend it for maximum impact.
    
    Many successful training programs combine storytelling with gamification elements and incorporate social proof throughout. The key is maintaining coherence and not overwhelming learners with too many competing approaches.

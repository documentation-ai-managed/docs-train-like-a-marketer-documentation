  <Expandable title="What makes training marketing different?" default-open="true">
    Unlike traditional marketing, training marketing focuses on behavior change and knowledge retention rather than product sales.
    
    The core difference lies in the objectives: while consumer marketing aims to drive purchases, training marketing seeks to facilitate learning and skill development. This fundamental shift requires adapting marketing techniques to educational contexts.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Is this approach evidence-based?" default-open="false">
    Yes, our methods are grounded in extensive research on adult learning and marketing psychology.
    
    We draw from decades of research in educational psychology, marketing science, and behavioral economics to ensure our techniques are not just effective but also sustainable for long-term learning outcomes.
